# Info about Zach
## Personal Info
I live in Mukilteo WA (about 45 minutes north of Seattle) with my wonderful wife Kristie and my adorable cat Jake.  I have been a manager at the Pacific Science Center for the last 7 years, overseeing their guest services.  Before working at the science center I was an Actuary and a math teacher.  My degree is in Mathematics from the University of Colorado and I also studied physics and astrophysics there.

## Programing Background
I am really excited about learning Python.  I have tried some things out in Python, but have not had any formal training.  Earlier in the year I took the Foundations 1 course in JavaScript.  For my job, I taught myself Visual Basic to help augment spreadsheets and database files.  As an Actuary, back in the day, I did some coding in Fortran and in college I took a course or two in C++ (but that was 20 years ago)

## Some programs that I created
* [Hello World](https://github.com/zachrickert/hello/blob/master/hello.py) - From the first class, I added a loop feature that will go through several languages.
* [Prime](https://github.com/zachrickert/prime/blob/master/prime.py) - Will print all of the primes up to a given number.
* [Pfactor](https://github.com/zachrickert/pfactor/blob/master/pfactor.py) - Will print out a prime factorization of a number.
