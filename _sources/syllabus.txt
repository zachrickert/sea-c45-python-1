You get a bonus (5th) point for turning in a perfect assignment

* On-time
* No mistakes or style errors, followed all directions.

You can resubmit as many times as necessary to get 4 points,
with the following caveats.

Late homework (including resubmits) will be accepted up to 1 week after the class has ended

I encourage you not to wait this long.
Teaching staff will guarantee grading each assignment once after
submission, and they will do their best to grade each new submission
as time allows, dividing up regrading time equally among all students.
